#Testify is a Python module that replaces the unittest module and nose. It is modeled after unittest, and it fully supports existing unittest classes.

# Testify includes functionalities that go beyond unittest:
    # Teardown fixture methods and Class-level setup are run only once for an entire class of test methods.
    # A decorator-based approach to fixture methods allows for features like lazy attribute evaluation and test context managers.
    # Test discovery has been improved. Testify can search across packages for test cases (similar to nose).
    # Support for finding and running test suites organized by modules, classes, or test methods.
    # The output of the test runner is attractive (color).
    # Extensible plugin system for providing new reporting functions.
    # Turtle (for mocking), code coverage integration, profiling, and various everyday assertion helpers for faster debugging are among the other helpful testing facilities included.
    # More naming standards in Python.
